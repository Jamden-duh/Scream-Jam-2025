  - "\u201COoh, a friend. And a powerful looking one, too! Yes, hello friend. You
    are an adventurer like me no doubt.\u201D "
  - "\u201CI can teach you a strong, strong move that may help you on your journey\u2026
    for a price.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHah! Only kidding, of course. Good company is hard to find, and harder
    to keep around. We have a duty to lend each other a hand, if you ask me!\u201D"
  - "\u201CStay safe out there, friend. This place is more dangerous than you know.
    We\u2019ll share our stories by campfire light someday, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201D "
