  - "\u201CGood day to you! You strike me as someone with an inquisitive mind, am
    I wrong? I am conducting an investigation of sorts.\u201D"
  - "\u201CSurely you have noticed the oddities of this place as well? Odd noises,
    peculiar smells, curious critters\u2026\u201D"
  - "\u201CI just can\u2019t put my paw on it, but something feels off, if only ever
    so slightly. Did you know that nobody here knows where this place is or how they
    got here? For goodness\u2019 sake, I don\u2019t think anyone here even knows
    their names! And we don\u2019t even question it? Dullards, the lot of them!\u201D "
  - "\u201CApologies, please excuse my rudeness. There just has to be something around
    here that will make it all make sense. I know they say curiosity killed the cat,
    but I\u2019m a raccoon, hoho!\u201D "
