  - "\u201CLook at you. You have an untouched mind, I can tell. Maybe that\u2019s
    for the best. The truth is not for everyone, heh heh.\u201D "
  - "\u201CThe world is full of truths, yes. It\u2019s a very good thing to feed
    your head and find them. We can see them when we fly, but we don\u2019t always
    like what we see, heh heh.\u201D "
  - "\u201CAnd you\u2026 you look awfully sad. Maybe it\u2019s best you stay on the
    ground. I\u2019m sure you can be perfectly happy without flying, heh heh.\u201D"
